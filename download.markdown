# Download ScalaCheck

ScalaCheck build artifacts are no longer published on this site. You can find builds published in [The Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/).

The easiest way to retrieve ScalaCheck is through sbt:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalacheck" %% "scalacheck" % "1.14.1" % "test"
```

There are still [older releases](releases.html) available on this site.
